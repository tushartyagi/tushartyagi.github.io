</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Life is ruled by time. Though some people get more and some people get
less time in their lives depending on how early they die, the reality is
that everyone gets equal number of hours everyday and this number gets
reset every 24 hours. In words of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2274/2274-h/2274-h.htm">Arnold
Bennett</a></p>
<blockquote>
We never shall have any more time. We have, and we have always had,
all the time there is.</blockquote>
<p>I got this idea that the time a person has can be divided amongst
different time scales and what scale one uses as the primary scale
defines the kind of life one has. Though I also guess this is like a
chicken and egg problem, the kind of scale a person chooses depends a
lot on that person, and vice versa.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Short Time Scale</strong>: The person using this scale thinks only a few
minutes in the future, lives impulsively and looks for instant
gratification in almost anything he does. Other people are stupid for
him, gadgets too slow, a delay in flight sends him to a state of
panic. He wants everything to be done instantly, thinking about life
is boring, so is introspection. If he is alone, access to TV or
facebook is paramount, girlfriend taking time to get ready is
painful. <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_God_Go">Eric Cartman</a>
came to my mind, who transported himself to the future in order to
get his hands on Wii. While this pattern is visible in me sometimes,
there are others I know who make it visible on a regular basis. Such
people move too fast for life because they are moving forward with
the speed of thought which is infinite, while the life moves ahead a
moment at a time. Years keep on flowing, and the realization that
life largely has passed often comes too late.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">&nbsp;<strong>Medium Time Scale</strong>: These people think in weeks at a time, they
do have goals but also the realisation that most the of the things do
not happen in instants and hence their goals are spread over time.
Office going people might fall in this category since they know that
a big project cannot finish in a week; there are far too many
variables and loose points to consider and realise to go ahead with
the implementation. People who have undertaken the task of learning
something new, especially which is artistic (and not logical which
our life is sadly filled with these days), like singing, instrument
or drawing also understand (or soon realise) that fixing the
foundation takes time and it's only after completing that one can
move forward. A person living on a short time scale will throw away
the instrument he's trying to learn because it's taking time, a
person using this time scale at least gets his fundamentals ready.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Long Time Scale</strong>: This time scale spans decades and covers a
lifetime and for people in this group, small setbacks do not matter.
A person living in this time-scale realises that even though his
favourite cup was broken by his maid, this is not going to affect his
tomorrow; even though he was insulted in front of a group of people,
this is not going to be remembered five years from now; a small
financial disaster isn't going to kill him, there is enough time
remaining to earn a bit more. Person living in this time scale
usually comes to understand that there are only a few things which
are necessary in life and everything else is
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">superficial</a>, not
adding to the quality and happiness of life. Life becomes his best
friend, always present, teaching him the essentials and this friend
is usually just a thought away. Person of this group knows that it
takes more than a few years to make who he is, and he has the
realisation that it will take his whole life to be what he wants to
be -- the best version of himself.</p>
</li>
<li><div class="first line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Infinite Time Scale</strong>: Just realise that more than <a class="reference external" href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx">90% of people
who ever lived are
dead</a>,
and ever since humans became intelligent enough to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization">start
civilizations</a>only
few million people (a figure I pulled out of thin air) have been
famous, which means more than 99% of people left without making
their mark. I might have taken
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/woody-allen-0913">this</a>
Woody Allen quote out of context, but he explains the infinite time
scale so beautifully:</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>It's just an accident that we happen to be on earth, enjoying our
silly little moments, distracting ourselves as often as possible
so we don't have to really face up to the fact that, you know,
we're just temporary people with a very short time in a universe
that will eventually be completely gone. And everything that you
value, whether it's Shakespeare, Beethoven, da Vinci, or
whatever, will be gone. The earth will be gone. The sun will be
gone. There'll be nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Often people don't live in this scale, and I guess they shouldn't on a
regular basis, but realization that such scale exists and death is as
much real as life gives a clearer outlook on life itself, for instance
life stops being a race and becomes a journey. It helps to care about
things which really matter and gives the confidence to do things which
one would never have done before.</p>
<p>I find it impossible to be always using only one scale. From what I
know, the best returns in the investment of life come from sometimes
using Infinite time scale; mostly using the Long and Medium scales and
staying away from using the short time scale as much as possible.</p>
