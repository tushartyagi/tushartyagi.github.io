</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I keep going back to some texts which are magical and give a great
perspective to life, the the life really happens and the magical effect
wears off, that's why I keep going back to them. David Foster Wallace's
speech &quot;This is water&quot; is one of such magical texts. I read it again a
few days ago to relearn that life really isn't about what I think it is
about, it's not only about me, it's not only about other, it's for all
of us, knowingly or otherwise my actions do affect other people. I don't
really give a damn about that thing, but there's another takewaway from
this text, it's that we constantly need to be aware of the way we are
living the life, spending the time or we'll 1) simply miss out on lot of
opputunities and incidents which keep on happening all around us, 2)
instead of taking a life as it is, we are going to get an incorrect
perception of it.</p>
<p>So in TIW, DFW serves the fact that the life of an average adult is
really boring most of the time. I can vouch for that, since on busy days
outside of office hours, the life simply goes by, I come home, cook,
read something, sleep, wake up, exercise a bit and go back to office.
Just this superficial desciption of life sounds boring. Time is slow
when it's passing but then you look back and realise that it went quite
fast.</p>
<p>Unless one is financially independent, Almost everyday of an adult's
life is boring, long, slow, until it ends and you wake up for another
day, when the previous day seems so small because you had been on the
auto mode all the previous day with only a handful of incidents to
remember, only a few conversations worth liking and and this goes on for
weeks, months, and years until the person realises that he doesn't
remember almost all the year that flew by. The best guess I can make is
that we have only a few hundred hours or so of memories out of an entire
year. (It's a different thing that we remember a lot of things that
happen to us, especially ones which are different but those are affected
by our present emotions/situations, but I'm talking about magical
memories. Read Stumbling On Happiness for more details on how we store
the memories).</p>
<p>The way I see it, there are two ways of remembering the life. The first
one is to have a journal of some sort, record all the great and bad
things that happen to you, it doesn't have to be filled everyday but the
more the better, it also gives the practice of clearning the thoughts
and adding new thoughts and ideas to whatever you're writing about.</p>
<p>The second thing and which DFW suggests so beautifully is to be more
mindful. First thing: Mindfulness is hard and one cannot be mindful all
the time, it's mentally taxing and uses the willpower (of which we have
limited amount). But when one starts to be more mindful, the returns are
exponential. just being mindful for a few more minutes in a day will not
only build the endurance of being more mindful over time, but also
increase the mindful life by a few days.</p>
<p>Like I wrote before, being mindful makes the life slow, one has more
time to enjoy every moment that passes and gets the option to live life
at an leisurely pace. When life is slow, like in the line at the
supermarket, it just might add a few minutes to the life, if one has the
attention of being more mindful. Instead of attending to the fat lady
and her crying kid, think about what good happened today and what all
things were you thankful for.</p>
