</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>If I take a seat while waiting for someone, the first reaction is to
pull the phone out of my pocket and start doing something on it;
starting usually with checking the time. I look around and see other
people doing that too; almost everyone who is alone is either listening
to the music, looking into their phone screens; even if there is a group
of people, chances are that they are doing something on their phone. It
won't be wrong to say that a lot of people are just zoning themselves
out by looking at the life of fantasy, past, future or someone else
(Facebook, twitter) and then thinking about how good or bad it is?</p>
<p>The human brain has been designed to think continuously, we had been
thinking and working our way out of obstacles, difficult and
life-threatening situations ever since we were animals living in the
forests. Then came the time when we had to think in order to hunt, kill,
eat, make fire, discover new ideas, invent new things, and as a result
we are living in a world full of comforts where almost everything can
now be done at a click of a button, this is magical going by the
standards of people living only 100 years ago.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily, all this thinking provided our brain with an auto-pilot
mode for a lot of situations; this is good and required so I don't have
to think too much when filling a glass of water and drinking from it, or
taking a car out for a ride. But the problem with zoning out is that in
a lot of situations I just do things without thinking about them at all,
as if I was high.</p>
<p>For instance, when I'm playing an interesting video game, or reading an
interesting book, the answer to every question that I'm asked becomes
&quot;Yes&quot;, and this causes a few surprises for me sometimes. The answer to
both &quot;Do you want to eat, I'm preparing something?&quot; and &quot;I'm going out,
I won't cook today.&quot; becomes &quot;OK&quot;, which is problematic in situations
when the food is ready and I am already full, or when there's no food
prepared and I'm famished. Another instance is when I just sit on a
chair and keep thinking about the future or the past.</p>
<p>Mindfulness, by its virtue, is about living life in the present, wherein
one's mind is full with whatever is going around him. It is about being
more physically present in the moment, than being mentally present. So
when you walk you can feel the ground, hear the tap of your shoes, feel
the gusts of wind on your face, feel the cloth on your body. The time
becomes a lot more slow, since you have so much to feel or observe in
every instance. It becomes a walking meditation, bringing inner peace
and calm, where the worries about the future and mistakes of the past
find no place. The person becomes an observer of whatever is going
around him; he passes no judgements, or thinks how he would do it
differently, because doing that takes him away from the present moment.</p>
<p>But living in the present is pretty difficult, since we are made to
think, to think about the past in order to learn from our mistakes, or
to think about the future in order to make plans and do things.</p>
<p>In the past, that made a lot of sense. When fire was discovered,
controlling it would have killed a lot of our ancestors. One of our
ancestors was killed because he was curious the way bushes were moving
that way and then was promptly killed by sabre toothed tiger. So
learning from the past served us to survive over the millenia.</p>
<p>Thinking about the future made us more open to new ideas, I imagine the
early humans saw that a few of their mates were killed after falling
over large and sharp stones, and they imagined what it would be like to
throw them at the enemies. Newton was possibly thinking about the future
when apple fell over his head (or in front of him, whatever the case).</p>
<p>But that much thinking isn't really needed for every hour of every day,
the life expectancy of humans have increased from a 30 to around 65, we
are no longer surrounded by so many threats and while the technology is
moving at an exponential rate, it's not going to help us to think about
the future too much at an individual level.</p>
<p>I've found that I have a habit of zoning out every now and then,
daydreaming about situations and while studies prove that it is good for
the brain and sparks creativity, and if I take a bus I know that I'm not
the only one doing that (one quick check is to see if the other person
is looking through you, into the infinite), and some of the ideas that I
have come from daydreaming and letting my mind go off the way, but that
isn't something that I want to do for a majority of time, after all
dreaming always feels better than doing.</p>
<p>Thinking too much about the past might depress us, and thinking too much
about the future might make us anxious, and that's why mindfulness
becomes important because it forces one to live in the present. The word
forces is important since this mode of living is difficult to be in
because of evolutionary wiring and because the whole idea of present is
so difficult to grasp because of it's transitive nature. It only comes a
moment at a time, unlike the past and the future which have a more
&quot;block&quot; like structure and are more easier to think about or imagine.
Unlike the past and the future, the present quickly becomes long, boring
or difficult.</p>

<div class="line">The advantages of mindfulness are though, multiple:</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Improved concentration</div>
<div class="line">Reduced anxiety</div>
<div class="line">Reduced depression</div>
<div class="line">Too many chances of getting into the flow</div>
<div class="line">Good ideas might come up more frequently</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The way I try to be more mindful is:</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Starting small, trying to be mindful in the tasks which only takes a
few seconds at a time, but occur very frequently or everyday like
eating, drinking, walking to the kitchen, toilet, in my room etc.</div>
<div class="line">Meditation</div>
<div class="line">Exercise</div>
<div class="line">Mindful walks few times a week</div>
<div class="line">Be more mindful, whenever the thought of being mindful comes up. It's
a cycle, be more mindful and the mind comes up with the idea of being
mindful.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The brain can be taught to do so many things, and I've noticed that once
I start being mindful more often throughout the day, the idea of being
more mindful keeps on coming up again and again</p>
