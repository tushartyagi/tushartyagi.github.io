</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>&quot;I've been thinking death lately&quot;, said a character of a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383028/">film</a> I saw a few days back.
And I've been thinking about it these days too. I guess if I die today
in my sleep, it wouldn't matter. It's not like that I want to die, but
suddenly the thought that I had in my mind was that once I'm dead, there
won't be anyone to dream more about the dreams that I have, there won't
be anyone who'll like to live the life I want to live. All my hopes and
aspirations will cease to exist the moment I cease to exist.</p>
<p>And it's not about just dying in your sleep, any type of death has the
same result: everything stops, nothing matters and the world around just
keeps moving the way it has always moved. Some prayers will be held,
some tears will be shed, and you'll be remembered but pretty soon <a class="reference external" href="http://www.inlex.org/stories/mansfield/thefly.html">even
that stops</a>.</p>
<p>Death is as real as life, and whatever life is made up of. All the
thoughts we have are real (truism is another matter), so are the
relationships we have, the air we breathe, the clothes we wear,
everything is real, and so is death. Everything is probable in life: one
can be rich, poor, smart, dumb, healthy, weak etc., but unlike death,
none of them is 100% certain.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Death is nothing to us, since when we are, death has not come, and
when death has come, we are not.&quot; -- Epicurus.</blockquote>
<p>But the fear of death, for most of us non-philosophers, is as certain as
death. And it's funny since life is about making choices, good or bad,
moral or evil (or neutral) but each one of them moves us closer to
death; and then, nothing, silence; there isn't a choice about that one.</p>
<p>It's not me only, but anyone who dies in sleep won't miss anything. It's
just like a long sleep, when the morning didn't come, a deep sleep
without the morning light. So is the case in any other type of death:
painful, painless, euthanasia induced death, the morning never comes.
The best you can do after death is to roll in your grave.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>There's an excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/stephen_cave_the_4_stories_we_tell_ourselves_about_death">Ted
talk</a>
by Stephen Cave about four ways of tricking ourselves into believing
that death is unreal and that somehow we can keep living in some other
life. So why do we do all this running away from death? The fear of
death is hard-wired into our brains and it's there in the head of
anything that moves. Ironically, without it, there's no living. Without
the fear of death, there's no difference between the rush of doing
something deadly, like bungee jumping and actually jumping off a cliff.
It's what saved us from predators across so many millennia. And then we
developed consciousness, invented religion and money and lo: dying
started to suck suddenly because we lose all that when we die. Fear of
death is pretty bad mentally and emotionally, but I guess instead of
treating death as something inevitable, people are brainwashed into
believing that something good happens after death, and this is ironical
again since people are supposed to be happy if something good is going
to happen to them after death. Does that mean that people are aware that
they're going to hang on a tandoor in hell because of all their evil
deeds and so simply dont' want to die and do anything to save their
asses?</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;We are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of
death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's
hands.&quot; Seneca in 1st letter to Lucilius</blockquote>
<p>So now we have seen the inevitability of death and why we fear it, the
question is what do we do about it? Well, apart from the fact that we
can't really delay it and can't totally remove it from the brain
wirings, the only reasonable way is to accept it. Ancient Greeks/Romans
(and civilizations around that part) were pretty smart; and suicidal.
They didn't believe in the concept of hiding behind gods and extending
their lives. They waged wars and died, or committed suicide (Seneca,
Cato) or embraced death (Cicero). We moderns aren't that manly (or
stupid, give or take) but we can learn from them none the less.</p>
<p>Stoics believed that reminding yourself that you're going to die one day
helps in reducing the fear of death.</p>
