</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>From time to time a thought strikes me, the fact that I am so lucky
sitting on my bed, sharing my thoughts, with absolutely not tension in
my mind as of now. A usual day starts when I wake up and exercise a bit,
maybe read a little, after which I'll get ready to go to office, have a
good breakfast, do my work for another 8-10 hours while sitting in a
comfortable place, come back, have dinner and sleep.</p>
<p>But when in the morning I go for exercise, there are people who -- after
all kinds of advancement I see around me -- are getting in line to get a
bucketful of water from the morning water supply. They make multiple
rounds from their homes to the municipal water tank which is almost a
kilometer away. They cross the same park where I am exercising, and when
I look I them, I consider how lucky I am. While their morning routine
can be considered as some sort of exercise, the hours following it
aren't as good as what I have. Most probably they'll have a half filled
or empty stomach when they go for work, they'll toil in the afternoon
sun, have an unsatisfying meal (to me atleast, but anything satisfies
when one's hungry), come back home. They don't get paid country's
average salary, and still I think they do a lot of country's total
physical work.</p>
<p>A few months ago a person asked me the same old &quot;what do you do&quot;
question. I replied that I am in IT. His reply &quot;Then you don't do any
laborious work&quot; infuriated me at the time, but in retrospect it is
somewhat correct. Mental strain isn't as bad as one that's physical, and
at times it's only boredom requiring a change of activity. But still
when this thought isn't in my mind, I consider my work to be very
&quot;laborious&quot;, and very meaningful, requiring ample amounts of mental
energies.</p>
<p>I guess that is the same with almost everyone. Our work gives us
identity and meaning in life, and while those are two independent
notions, we kind of confuse the two. Our work defines the life we have,
and our life is defined by the work we do. We go to work for more than
the payroll-required 8 hours, come back home and discuss it, sleep about
it, dream about it; outside of work we meet people who do similar kinds
of work -- I don't find it odd that I meet IT guys wherever I go, the
doctors and lawyers are exceptions, authors are exotic, fashion
designers are once in a decade (since I've only met two till now).</p>
<p>But that only seems odd when I think about it, just like the people
running around for water seem odd only when I think about them. Outside
of park they are strangers to me, every day I see them, have similar
thoughts -- which will eventually cease to be once I've seen them enough
times. But do I really want that to happen? Of course, no.</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace's <a class="reference external" href="http://metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf">&quot;This is
water&quot;</a> is one of
the best thought provoking article I've read. It's starts with the fact
that how water feels so casual and mundane to fishes, (if they could
think) they lose touch about what is in excess, the same way we humans
lose touch what's in excess around us. Instead of being a social and
friendly, we turn aloof and cold,&nbsp; focused on our own thoughts and
forgetting the fact that they too have similar thoughts, anxieties,
emotions, and especially a self-centered life where they want to be
treated the way I want to be treated.</p>
<p>Does he want to us to be an agent of change, go out in the world trying
to change it? Nope. And in our day to day life that does becomes
overwhelming, and sometimes futile. But what we can do is to be a bit
more considerate to people around us; aware of the water that surrounds
us.</p>
<p>While this sounds so negative, seeing those people in the park makes me
feel lucky about the life that I have. The probability that I am alive
as a human is miniscule on the grand scale of time and universe, and the
kind of comfortable life that I (or any of my family members and
friends) have is again improbable to the point of being impossible. And
this fact is what I believe keeps me a bit more considerate about those
who aren't as lucky as me. I haven't become an agent of change, nor I
think I'll be in the foreseeable future, but the fact that I'm aware of
the water, will keep me satisfied for a long, long time.</p>
