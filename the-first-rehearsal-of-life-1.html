</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Almost every religion teaches about a life after death. A person will
either live in some sort of paradise, living a life amidst unlimited
food, milk, music and virgins, or will go through excruciating pain in
hell; in some books he will be born again as a human, a monkey, a
mosquito or as some other form of life. Since I am an atheist, all these
ideas sound a bit crazy to me. I like to believe that we just die,
nothing else happens afterwards and wagering on the fact that there’s a
life after death takes away or hinders the pleasures that are available
in the life right now.</p>
<p>Is this life always full of pleasures? No, it isn’t. But has there ever
been a proof that it will be so after I die? I’ve never met a ghost in
my life, who can explain that there is life after death. Nor have I been
reached out by some angel giving me the details of the next big plan. So
l like to live life thinking that there won’t be another one after I
die.</p>
<p>The idea for what I’m writing now came after I started reading “The
Unbearable Lightness of Being” which had the following sentence
somewhere in the beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
What can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life
itself?</blockquote>
<p>I have not finished that book so I don’t know the answer of this
question as described in the book, but I’ll try to answer that question
using the ideas and thoughts that I’ve come across living the life.
Maybe I’ll write another updated post after I’ve finished that book but
as of now I’ll just go ahead without filling any blanks. FYI: It’s an
interesting read.</p>
<p>So, coming back, different people have different answers to that
question. There are some, which live in the future, waiting for the next
life since this one is filled with bad people, screwed up opportunities
and a totally wrong/indecent way of living. For those people, this life
isn’t worth living, it’s just a painful journey which they have to bear
in order to get closer to their real, eternal life, which ironically
starts after they die. Ironically too, for all the love they have for
the next life, such people won’t take their lives in order to reach the
final destination a wee bit early, they are waiting for some divine
intervention in order to reach the eternal place of belonging.</p>
<p>The idea of eternal life is amazing. Sometimes I want to live eternally,
not to meet some sort of creator, but to see where the world is going
and how it will be a few hundred years from now. How the galaxy is going
to be a few million years from now and how the universe is going to be a
few trillion years from now. While I like living in fantasy, I also like
to keep a foot in the present moment and that reminds me what I’m
thinking isn’t going to happen and it is better to live the life as it
is presented to me, a moment at a time. And since I don’t believe in
reincarnation, the life that I am living right now becomes the first
rehearsal and final take of life.</p>
<p>This realization was unsettling when I first thought about it, because I
wasn’t always non-religious. I had the mental conditioning of believing
that there will be a reincarnation and if I did good deeds, I’ll born a
human again. And suddenly when that comforting thought was removed from
my grip, life indeed became a bit difficult and confusing because the
principle of my life for so many years was that there’s another life
after death. What shall I do if I will just die someday with nothing
following afterwards; why had I been taught that there is life after
death? Those and other thoughts plagued my mind.</p>
<p>Time passed after I had those thoughts and then, after a long journey
where I read so many books and came across different ideas, I logically
deduced that it’s much better to be a better human being in this life
than to wait for another one after this ends. The life that I am living
right now, is full of beautiful segments which are divided across so
many years with every segment presenting something new and challenging
to me. I’ve only completed two decades -- I remember nothing of the
first one and the second one was filled with emotional highs -- but
those two have prepared me to look forward to the gentle unfolding of
the pattern of life.</p>
<p>Then again the question comes which Milan Kunder asked in his book:
<strong>What can life be worth if the first rehearsal for life is life
itself?</strong> The answer that I have is what the life has taught me in the
last few years: it goes on. It’s not something for which you have to
rehearse in order to live, when living my life, I have to be like an
actor of improv theater, who starts with no story whatsoever and as the
hero, have to make the story, find the answers, make decisions and deal
with the consequences as they come. And the more I’ll accept the
situations, the better the play will become. There’s no point fighting
against every situation and every person, some of them are good and can
help me.</p>
<p>I also realized that I cannot have any control over a lot of situations
that life throws at me. I can have control over the thoughts that I have
and the actions that I take when faced with challenges, but anything
beyond that is out of my control and I am too insignificant to make any
damage. I cannot rehearse, I don’t have the option of doing that, the
only option that I have is to just go with the flow, keeping an eye on
situations and acting on those which I can affect.</p>
