</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In addition to the whole idea of <a class="reference external" href="http://tushartyagi.com/rationality-and-reality/">Rationality and
Reality</a>, I came to
realise that I even have phases of complacency and procrastination as
well. The first one simply makes me more lazy, because everything in
life is just fine while the second one guarantees that everything in
future is going to be a-ok. And what else do I need? Living in the
present while the future seems rosy, this is supposed to be life. Throw
in the fact my general idea that I can't change the past, but can only
learn from it and every aspect of time, and every phase of life seems to
be taken care of.</p>
<p>But while this seems to be the general mode of life that I (and possibly
a lot of other people) delve in, the autopilot mode, reality is that
there are so many things which are going on around me, which I seem to
miss. If I look at what tangible thing I have done, what have I
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.uarts.edu/neil-gaiman-keynote-address-2012">made</a> (good
or whatever), I see that I have absolutely nothing to show here. In the
past few months, I've not</p>
<p>* posted any article on the site</p>
<p>* learned any piece of music on any instrument which I bought out of
sheer love of music,</p>
<p>* read a lot which helps me professionally,</p>
<p>* applied anything which I read otherwise(I've read a lot of behavioral
and cognitive psychology stuff), so there have been only a few personal
gains,</p>
<p>And even in the hot winters of Hyderabad, my mind slips around on a
slippery slope; never to be in control and in place for longer than
normal duration.</p>
<p>I came across a subreddit a few months ago:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay">r/nonzeroday</a> and I really
liked the idea, and then it went back and got archived in the storehouse
of my memories. Yesterday I came across it too, after reading a few
posts about discipline, psychology, and behavior and I realised that I
already know about. But even at that time I felt that while the idea
behind that subreddit is so simple, and at worst you need 5 minutes to
do the job, and it's not so difficult to use it, to apply it, to
integrate it in my life, I've not been doing that. And this thought
instantly pops up in my head: But I *need* more than 5 minutes to
better myself, 5 minutes don't do shit. And I asked myself: Really?</p>
<p>What shall I call this behavior, I don't really know, and my mind is
jumping up and down to find that word, because it'll increase my
vocabulary, and it doesn't matter I'll lose the flow of thought that I
have here and simply get lost in the vastness of internet.</p>
<p>Seneca, in one of his letters, explained what a lot of people write huge
books about:&nbsp;everything should start with planning, because anything
that starts with planning, succeeds. That's something Edison lacked
apparently, according to
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1010603-if-he-thomas-edison-had-a-needle-to-find-in">this</a>quote
by Tesla,</p>
<blockquote>
If Edison had a needle to find in a haystack, he would proceed at
once with the diligence of the bee to examine straw after straw
until he found the object of his search. â€¦ I was a sorry witness of
such doings, knowing that a little theory and calculation would have
saved him ninety per cent of his labor</blockquote>
<p>(maybe that's why the former took 10000 tries, but again he created
electric bulb and I've not yet invented anything so I'll keep my mouth
shut about how inventors should work.)</p>
<p>Proper planning is something that has to be foundation of anything that
we start, and once you're wasting the time and life being in the modes
of satisfying present and a rosy past, planning cannot take place, at
least it won't get the first priority. Instead of planning and then
executing, a lazy ass will just stay on couch for the longest time, and
then rush to the work at the very last minute; taking more time and
possibly screwing it up a few times before actually delivering a sub
quality thing. That happens a lot in software development, quite
possibly because we are given enough chanced to screw around before
delivering the end product. Not a lot of other professions allow that. A
doctor cannot test his hypothesis on a live subject, a civil engineer
won't be having an alpha, beta, and RC testing for a bridge that he's
building. Only software world has that power of messing and cleaning up
stuff at regular basis.</p>
<p>So where am I going? It's difficult to understand (I can pull in some
philosophy in this as well: who has the idea where he or she is going),
but when you realise that you haven't done anything worthwhile in a lot
of time, simply pondering over the subject just don't cut it. You have
to pick yourself up from the couch, quite possibly slap yourself, and
then start doing stuff by planning and structuring your work, and
keeping your priorities straight.</p>
<p>Having said that, I was (in a fit of rage right now) thinking about
writing more regularly, either here or on tushartyagi.github.io (which
has a terrible UI in spite of being a CSS blog :/), and share what I
have learned on either programming or life in general.</p>
